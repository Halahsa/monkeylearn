monkeylearn
=============

UNDER DEVELOPMENT!!

This package is an interface to the [MonkeyLearn API](http://docs.monkeylearn.com/article/api-reference/). MonkeyLearn is a Machine Learning platform on the cloud that allows software companies and developers to easily extract actionable data from text.

# What it does for now

Nearly nothing, but here is an example.

```{r}
library("monkeylearn")
text1 <- "lions are very big animals"
text2 <- "i want to buy an iphone"
request <- c(text1, text2)
output <- monkeylearn_classify(request)
output

```
