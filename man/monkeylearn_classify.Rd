\usage{
monkeylearn_classify(request, key = monkeylearn_key(quiet = TRUE),
  classifier_id = "cl_oFKL5wft", verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{request}{A vector of characters (each text smaller than 50kB)}

\item{key}{The API key}

\item{classifier_id}{The ID of the classifier}

\item{verbose}{whether to output messages about batch requests}
}
\value{
A list of two data.frames (dplyr tbl_df), one with the results, the other with headers including the number of remaining queries as "x.query.limit.remaining".
}

\details{
Find IDs of classifiers using \url{https://app.monkeylearn.com/main/explore}.
 You can use batch to send up to 200 texts to be analyzed within the API
 (classification or extraction) with each request.
So for example, if you need to analyze 6000 tweets,
instead of doing 6000 requests to the API, you can use batch to send 30 requests,
each request with 200 tweets.
The function automatically makes these batch calls and waits if there is a throttle limit error,
but you might want to control the process yourself using several calls to the function.
